# Design Pattern Comparison

A comparison of implementation patterns between two applications: the production-ready **frontend** and the prototype **UX**.

## Project Overview

This project showcases side-by-side comparisons of key architectural decisions and implementation patterns:

- **Wizard vs Modal workflows**
- **Redux + RTK Query vs React useState**
- **Enterprise validation vs Basic form validation**
- **Comprehensive status handling vs Simple indicators**
- **PatternFly tables vs Custom HTML tables**

## Architecture Comparison

### frontend (Production)
- **PatternFly 4.x** components
- **Redux + RTK Query** state management  
- **Multi-step wizard** workflows (15+ steps)
- **Comprehensive validation** system with custom hooks
- **Enterprise data tables** with sorting, filtering, pagination
- **Detailed error handling** with structured error objects

### UX (Prototype)  
- **PatternFly 4.x** components
- **React useState** hooks for state management
- **Modal-based** workflows with tabs
- **Basic form validation** 
- **Custom HTML tables** with simple interactions
- **Streamlined error handling** with toast notifications

## Key Insights

### When to Use Enterprise Patterns (Frontend)
- Building production applications
- Complex state management requirements  
- Need for comprehensive error handling
- Long-term maintainability
- Team collaboration at scale

### When to Use Prototype Patterns (UX)
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Simple state requirements
- Demo and proof-of-concept projects
- Learning and experimentation
- Quick time-to-market

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Design System

Built with **PatternFly 5.x** components for modern design consistency and accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **PatternFly React** design system
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Webpack** for bundling
- **Jest** for testing

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Architectural trade-offs between enterprise and prototype approaches
- State management pattern comparisons
- Form validation strategy differences  
- UI/UX pattern implementations
- Code organization and maintainability considerations
